Projects
--------

Linux Administration

:   I've used Linux for ~7 years full-time, and in that time have deployed home theater
    systems, local servers, and sustained hardware using lightweight variants of Linux. 

Python

:   I use Python for as much as I can for what I want to do for scripting, from working
	in Ren'Py as gifts to data analysis with the NumPy stack.

Side Projects

:   Actively contributing to/working on multiple code projects, including:

	+ github-white-noise (Javascript)
	+ numix-solarized-gtk-theme (Python/CSS)

:   Promoting data driven methodologies within the school system. I made my job as a desk attendant
    at OSUIT's Residential Life department a project in digitizing their workflow to increase the 
    department's understanding of the student body, like converting paper forms to Google Forms format
    for easy-to-interpret results.
